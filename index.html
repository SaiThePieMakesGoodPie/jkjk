          Listening to music has been a culture iv'e adapted to when i'm any mood. Doing work or not i lsiten to music. Thomas edison says,"There is always a better way", and i think music has made me find those better ways in either learning or think. As humble as i can say this..... music helps everyone and if you don't agree try it for yourself.
